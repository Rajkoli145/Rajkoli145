## About me

I’m a developer who believes skills are earned by building — not by talking about them.

I enjoy understanding how systems work behind the scenes: APIs, databases, logic, data flow, and structure.  
Most of my time goes into full-stack development, with a growing focus on backend systems and AI-driven features.

Hackathons, side projects, and fixing broken code teach me more than tutorials ever could — that’s where I learn best.

## Current focus

- Strengthening core CS and backend fundamentals  
- Building real projects instead of demos  
- Exploring AI by implementing things from scratch  
- Designing scalable, maintainable systems
