# Hi, I'm Raj 👋

I’m a developer who learned by building — breaking things, fixing them, and doing it again until it worked.

Code is my notebook.  
Every repository here represents something I learned the hard way.

## 🚀 My Journey (0 → Real Projects)

I didn’t start with fancy frameworks or perfect plans.

I started with:
- basic HTML, CSS
- small JavaScript projects
- cloning real-world apps to understand how things actually work

Over time, I moved to:
- full-stack projects
- hackathons & rapid prototyping
- open-source contributions
- thinking in terms of **systems**, not just code

This GitHub is a timeline of that progress.

## 🛠 What I Work With

**Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- UI-focused builds (clean, simple, usable)
- Animations & interactive components

**Backend & Logic**
- Node.js
- APIs & basic system design
- Data handling & flow

**Tools & Platforms**
- Git & GitHub
- Firebase
- Render / basic deployment
- No-code tools (Bubble) when speed matters

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here

- 🔁 App clones (to understand real products)
- 🧩 Small focused projects (one concept at a time)
- 🏗 Full projects built end-to-end
- 🧠 Experiments from hackathons & learning sprints

I care more about **clarity and learning** than just stacking stars.

---

## 📈 Current Focus

- Building production-quality projects
- Writing cleaner, more understandable code
- Open-source collaboration (reading others’ code, not just mine)
- Improving frontend polish + system thinking

## 🤝 How I Think About Code

- Simple > clever
- Shipped > perfect
- Learning > showing off

If something here looks rough, it probably taught me something valuable.
