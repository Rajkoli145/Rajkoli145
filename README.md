# Hi, I'm Raj 👋

I’m a developer who learned by building — breaking things, fixing them, and doing it again until it worked.

Code is my notebook.  
Every repository here represents something I learned the hard way.

## 🚀 My Journey (0 → Real Projects)

I didn’t start with fancy frameworks or perfect plans.

I started with:
- basic HTML, CSS
- small JavaScript projects
- cloning real-world apps to understand how things actually work

Over time, I moved to:
- full-stack projects
- hackathons & rapid prototyping
- open-source contributions
- thinking in terms of **systems**, not just code

This GitHub is a timeline of that progress.

## 🛠 What I Work With

**Frontend**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- UI-focused builds (clean, simple, usable)
- Animations & interactive components

**Backend & Logic**
- Node.js
- APIs & basic system design
- Data handling & flow

## 🛠 Languages, Tools & Platforms

**Languages**
- JavaScript (primary)
- TypeScript (used in real projects & SDK work)
- HTML & CSS
- Python (scripting & logic)
- C / C++ (DSA & fundamentals)
- SQL (basic querying)
- COBOL (learning & legacy-system exposure)

**Frameworks & Libraries**
- Next.js (React-based apps & routing)
- Node.js
- Chart.js (data visualization)

**Backend & Systems**
- REST APIs
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, rules)
- Basic system design & data flow

**Tools & Platforms**
- Git & GitHub 
- Render 
- Bubble 
- Postman 
- VS Code
- Terminal-based workflows

**Low-Level / Systems Learning**
- Terminal Bench (CPU-time, performance-oriented tasks)

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here

- 🔁 App clones (to understand real products)
- 🧩 Small focused projects (one concept at a time)
- 🏗 Full projects built end-to-end
- 🧠 Experiments from hackathons & learning sprints

I care more about **clarity and learning** than just stacking stars.

---

## 📈 Current Focus

- Building production-quality projects
- Writing cleaner, more understandable code
- Open-source collaboration (reading others’ code, not just mine)
- Improving frontend polish + system thinking

---

## 🤝 How I Think About Code

- Simple > clever
- Shipped > perfect
- Learning > showing off

If something here looks rough, it probably taught me something valuable.
